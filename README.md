# ðŸ“° News App

A simple yet powerful **News App** built with **HTML and JavaScript** that fetches the latest news from the [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/). This project demonstrates how to integrate a backend API, dynamically display content on a front-end interface, and provide seamless navigation to the original news sources.

## **How It Works**

1. The application uses the **NewsAPI** to fetch top headlines or news by category.

3. Each card contains a "Read More" button, which redirects users to the full news article on the original source website.
